### The Program tested in a different Samples of Grids Like 
   1.<b>Easy Grid</b>  <br>```{{0,9,3,0,5,0,0,0,4}, {0,0,7,0,0,0,0,8,0}, {5,6,0,9,0,0,0,0,7}, {0,8,0,0,3,9,4,2,0}, {0,4,0,8,2,7,0,3,0},    {0,3,5,6,1,0,0,9,0}, {9,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,2}, {0,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0}, {3,0,0,0,4,0,8,7,0}};```

   2.<b>Hard Grid</b>  <br>```{{0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0}, {8,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,9}, {7,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0}, {2,0,5,9,0,0,0,3,0}, {0,6,0,8,0,1,0,5,0}, {0,1,0,0,7,5,9,0,6}, {0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,3}, {1,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,2}, {0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0}};```
 
   3.<b>Very Hard Grid</b>  <br>```{{8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,7,0,0,9,0,2,0,0}, {0,5,0,0,0,7,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,4,5,7,0,0}, {0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0}, {0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8}, {0,0,8,5,0,0,0,1,0}, {0,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,0}};```
 
   4.<b>Multiple Solutions Grid</b>  <br>``` {{0,0,8,0,0,1,7,0,0}, {0,3,0,0,6,4,0,0,9}, {2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0}, {0,0,2,8,4,6,5,0,0}, {0,0,1,0,0,0,9,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,2}, {7,0,0,4,5,0,0,9,0}, {0,0,9,7,0,0,4,0,0}};```
 
   5.<b>No Solutions Grid</b>  <br>```{{8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,7,0,0,9,0,2,0,0}, {0,5,0,0,0,0,7,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,4,5,7,0,0}, {0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0}, {0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8}, {0,0,8,5,0,0,0,1,0}, {0,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,0}};```
